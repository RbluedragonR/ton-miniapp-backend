# ARIX TERMINAL - RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT (v22 - FINAL)
# ===================================================================================
# This script contains all necessary fixes for deployment. It deletes the Dockerfile,
# creates a correct nixpacks.toml, and uses the correct 'redeploy' command.
# It does NOT modify any application code (e.g., app.js).
